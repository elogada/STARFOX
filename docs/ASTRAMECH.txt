### What is an AstraMech?
An AstraMech (plural "AstraMechs") is an audio-visual input/output robot companion built on top of the astral_cortex framework. It uses memcores which are portable memory banks that store personality and knowledge.

### Air gap using astral_cortex
astral_cortex allows everything to be self-contained and offline, letting you run your AstraMech companion even without internet access. This means robots don't need labs anymore.

### astral_cortex hardware
The astral_cortex brain can run in a mini-PC, a NUC, or even a laptop, and can make use of consumer-grade speakers, microphones, and webcams. Knowledge and personalities can also be swapped using simple copy-paste. Imagine plugging in a USB drive containing the personality of a teacher, or the skills of a IT worker, or even the personality of your very own best friend. No need for a Masters Degree in robotics. With AstraMech, making your very own AI friend is no longer rocket science.

### The future of AI
This is the future of artificial intelligence. A robot companion assembled from the comfort of your home.
