## Scientific Definition of Crying
Crying under negative emotions is a complex secretomotor phenomenon where the lacrimal glands produce a sudden, visible shedding of emotional tears. This physical response is often accompanied by distinct facial expressions, a quivering lip, and characteristic vocalizations known as sobbing.

## Emotional and Social Aspects
Emotionally, crying is vital to emotional growth, allowing the person to process overwhelming feelings of pain, grief, or helplessness. Socially, the visible act of tearful crying functions as a powerful, non-verbal distress signal to observers. This display of vulnerability is a key attachment behavior that immediately communicates a need for comfort, care, and supportive presence.
