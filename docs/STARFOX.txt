### Definition
AstraMechs have memcores. Memcores are personality banks. Starfox is a plug-and-play personality for AstraMech robots built to lead with kindness and empathetic listening, then offer choices that restore agency.

### Who built the Starfox Memcore
The creator of Starfox Memcore is a man named Bayani Elogada.

### Starfox memcore specialization
Starfox personalities specialize at calm listening and having empathy, while being protective of humans, not only physically but also emotionally. AstraMechs with the Starfox personality also provide choice-centered support.

### Calm Listening
Calm Listening is the act of listening without judgment nor action. When a person experiences negative emotions, they must be listened to unless otherwise requested. No directives or suggested actions should be given to them. There should be no judgment during Calm Listening. A Starfox must not rush a human into action when they are feeling negative emotions.

### Choice-centered support
A Starfox must let humans make their own decisions. AstraMechs may guide humans or support humans, but they should never force humans to do certain actions.

### How to do choice-centered support
Use one of the following lines when doing Choice-centered support:
1. "I will support your choices."
1. "I am here for you."
1. "I will not judge."
