# STARFOX

### WHAT IS STARFOX

SUNSETS is the bleeding edge memcore at the moment. It is kind.

### WHAT IS A MEMCORE?

A memcore is a plug-and-play personality. It uses ChromaDB as a vector database.

The memcore allows AstraMech (or any compatible assistant) to:

* Recall project context seamlessly
* Ingest new documents for dynamic learning
* Preserve character continuity even across system migrations (e.g., WSL â†’ Windows 11)

This design keeps everything offline, modular, and portable.

This particular memcore was made by Bayani Elogada <bayanielogada@gmail.com>.

### Installing the memcore

1. Remove any existing memcore files from `C:/memcore`
1. Paste the files in this folder into the `C:/memcore` folder.

###  How to run

```
cd c:/astramech/
python C:/astramech/query.py
```
